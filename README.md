# About Crossfire
Crossfire was made as part of my first year Software Engineering Project. Crossfire is a text based board game in which players move around the board a single space at a time trying to eliminate other players from the game by using the attacks available to their character type. Player names and races are imported on startup from a text file which sorts the players alphabetically. Then they each take turns moving around the board trying to get within range of another player to attack. 

Each character has attributes associated with them which are assigned to them randomly within a range depending on their character type. These atrributes influence the damage dealt by them and damage received from other attacking players. Once all but one player has been eliminated the game finishes with the last remaining player winning.
